<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>


<h6> Who maintain CoreBR? </h6>

<p>CoreBR is maintained by the <a href="http://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/">Applied Software Engineering Research Group</a>, 
 from Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. However, the project is not endorsed by UFMG or any Brazilian research agency.</p>
    
<h6>How CoreBR works?</h6>

<p> Papers are collected, using scripts, from <a href="http://dblp.uni-trier.de/">DBLP</a>. 
We only collect full papers, accepted in the main research track of the considered conferences.</p>

<h6>How are the results presented?</h6>

<p> The data collected by CoreBR is presented using Google spreadsheets, in four sheets:

<ul>
<li> Summary: number of full research papers with at least one Brazilian author published in the
conferences tracked by CoreBR during the period 2013-2017
<li> Profs: Brazilian researchers tracked by CoreBR
<li> Papers: data about the papers collected by CoreBR
<li> Confs: sponsors and other statistics about the conferences covered by CoreBR
</ul>
</p>

<h6>What conferences are tracked?</h6>

<p> First, it is important to mention that there is no predefined limit on the number of conferences 
in each research area. But we do not intend to cover a large number of conferences. The number we 
have in mind is at most 15 conferences per research area. For each area, it is mandatory to cover the
top conferences and the below-the-fold conferences, as considered 
by <a href="http://csrankings.org/">CSRankings</a>.</p>

<h6>Why my paper is not listed?</h6>

<p>
Please, first check if it is a full paper, published in the conferences tracked by CoreBR (listed in
the Confs sheet), in the last five years (2013-2017). If this is the case, also check if your 
name is listed in the Profs sheet (which is a list of the Brazilian researchers tracked by CoreBR).
If not, please open an <a href="https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/CoreBR/issues">issue</a> at GitHub, informing your name and 
<a href="http://dblp.uni-trier.de/faq/How+can+I+fetch+all+publications+of+one+specific+author.html">PID</a> 
at DBLP.</p>

<h6>Why conference [Conf] is not covered?</h6>

<p> We accept suggestions to track other conferences. However, as the name of the project suggests, 
our main interest is on high-quality conferences, with good metrics (number of submitted/accepted papers,
h5-index, etc) and also well-known sponsors (ACM SIGs, IEEE CS, etc). If you think this is the case of [Conf],
please open an <a href="https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/CoreBR/issues">issue</a> at GitHub, informing 
the statistics abut this conference in 2017 (see the 
required statistics in the Confs sheet, in the spreadsheet with the results provided by CoreBR). </p>

<h6>How can I help so that CoreBR covers an research area X?</h6>

<p> First, enter in contact providing basic statistics about the core conferences in X, in our opinion (see the
required statistics in the Confs sheet, in the spreadsheet with the results provided by CoreBR).
If we approve your list of conferences, you will also need to provide a list of Brazilian researchers
in area X, including their 
<a href="http://dblp.uni-trier.de/faq/How+can+I+fetch+all+publications+of+one+specific+author.html">DBLP PIDs</a>,
(see Profs sheet).</p>

<h6>What is your definition of research area?</h6>

<p> A research area must have a Special Interest Group (Comissao Especial) at SBC or ACM.</p>

<h6>Do you plan to cover journals?</h6>

<p> Yes, but only after covering conferences in a representative number of CS research areas.</p>

<h6>Do you plan to track papers from other countries?</h6>

<p> Yes, by creating CoreXX forks; but not in the near future.</p>
